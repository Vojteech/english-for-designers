## Projects



### Skoba
Skoba is a small shop in Prague with beautiful diaries and notebooks. I work with them for almost a year now and I really enjoy our cooperation. I get to be part of the creative process of why is the product special and how we wanna show that which is something I really appreciate.

With this notebook for festival Colours of Ostrava we wanted to show the contrast between the colorful notebook and the rusty metal place where the festival is held.





### Diary
This is my own project and my own passion. I started my photography journey with street photography and it will always have a special place in my heart. Nowadays I enjoy using film camera and capturing moments around me which creates something like my diary.

### Concerts
Sometimes I have a chance to capture a concert which for me is a more creative and nonformal type of photography which I really enjoy. Concert photography is really inspiring for me and the plan is to use this inspiration to create more cinematic projects in the future.
