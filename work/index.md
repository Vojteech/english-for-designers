# Projects

Skoba
Skoba is a small shop in Prague with beautiful diaries and notebooks. I work with them for almost a year now and I really enjoy our cooperation. I get to be part of the creative process of why is the product special and how we wanna show that which is something I really appreciate.

Colours of Ostrava
With this notebook for festival Colours of Ostrava we wanted to show the contrast between the colorful notebook and the rusty metal place where the festival is held.

Boh√©ma
Those notebooks are made out of shirts which could not be sold because of a printing error.
