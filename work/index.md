## Projects



### Skoba
Skoba is a small shop in Prague with beautiful diaries and notebooks. I work with them for almost a year now and I really enjoy our cooperation. I get to be part of the creative process of why is the product special and how we wanna show that which is something I really appreciate.

With this notebook for festival Colours of Ostrava we wanted to show the contrast between the colorful notebook and the rusty metal place where the festival is held.

### Diary
This is my own project and my own passion. I started my photography journey with street photography and it will always have a special place in my heart. Nowadays I enjoy using film camera and capturing moments around me which creates something like my diary.
