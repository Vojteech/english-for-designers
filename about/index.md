## About me

As you probably already found out, my name is Vojtech and I´m a photographer.
I studied comprehensive school which means I wasn´t sure what is the next step that I wanna take. Luckily I started with photography and found a passion that never went away.

I create photos that have a story behind them and look good at the same time. I look for emotion in sport or event photography, I show story of the product in product photography and capture unique stories of everyday situations.

I believe that photography is a craft that you are learning your whole life
