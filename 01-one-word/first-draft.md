# But

“But” is a word that can change everything, “but” can surprise you, “but” can make your day and your life can even depend on one simple “but”.
The thing about the word “but” is that you never know whats coming after it. It could be the best news in your life or the most dissappointing turn of the sentence. There is times when you hope that there is a “but” coming to save the situation and there is times when you wish that “but” is locked in a cell far far away. “But” can be your savior but also your worst enemy.
So i like “but” but maybe not so much.
